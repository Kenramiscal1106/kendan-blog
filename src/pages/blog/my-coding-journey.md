So, I started coding on January 2020. I got curious on how webpages work and I remembered once on how I got so confused and amused at how these gibberish letters with `<h1>Hello, world</h1>` outputs a result on a web browser. It was interesting for me at the time and I also really like to code. 

And also at that time, I see grade 8 students writing *code* in the library and when they hit save, they get pretty interesting results. Back then, I was introduced to html. And I got really excited learning it. Ever since that day, I would go to  the [w3schools](https://w3schools.com) website just to learn all about html. And then, I showed off to a bunch of my classmates how I can change the text of a website. 

But comparing my knowledge at that time to my knowledge about coding today, the comparison would be like a 2-story apartment to a 30-story hotel. Back then, I was learning too little and I realized that most of the things that I created using barebones HTML was nothing compared to the ones like messenger, facebook, youtube, and all that kind of stuff because really looks ugly. So, I started learning on how to style the gibberish elements that I display on the page while coding. And I found out about css.

CSS was one of the most clear, and the most confusing when the codebase grows. And most of the time, I was just using plain css. CSS was a [[json|json-like]] styling language that has the principle of cascading. The style that was last declared in the file or `<style>` tag is the one that applies to the different styles. Of course, CSS doesn't end there. It also has specificity for styling elements. And it was such a mental overhead that I tried to quit web development. But fortunately, with a little organization and effort, I was able to make small projects with it.

But then I asked myself this question: if Wordpress can handle the whole website stuff, why do I need to code in html and css? And when I realized that I don't really need to code html and css, I think doing this isn't necessary. That is what led me to quit making websites and start making desktop/mobile apps, command line interfaces, and so on.

To do that, I tried using python for programming. Python, in my opinion, is the first real programming language that I've learned. Python, has a very easy syntax that is easy to understand, very minimal way of writing code due to it having a small amount of keywords. I mean, just look at it.

```python
a_variable = 20
def print_var(insert_arg):
	print(a_variable)
```

I then realized that learning the concepts of functions and object-oriented programming is hard. Also, I realized that you can never make any real apps with these programming language. And so, I begin to wonder if, learning this can really make apps. Technically, variables, for loops, conditional statements only print out some `Hello, World!` in the command line. But even so, I tried understanding functions and arguments, classes, objects until I fully know what it is. I was shocked to realize that the concepts of functions and objects are easy.

Functions, in the context of Math, is just a wrapper around an equation that gives the **same output** given the **same input**. But functions don't end there. In programming, functions can do a lot more that. It can also do side-effects, mutations, or a combination of one of these.

Objects, in the context of programming, is just an instance of a class, which is just a wrapper of logic. It has properties, methods to change the properties, and readonly properties. It's as simple as that. 

Then after I know enough in coding python, I tried to make a calculator app. I watched videos on how to make calculator with tkinter. And when I finished making my app, it doesn't look good. I think it just looks like an app that came from the 90's. And so, I tried finding other solutions for making an app but never really had the courage to try them.

And since, web technologies are readily available when you visit a website, I try making websites anyways. But this time, I was trying to make it more interactive. So, I tried learning javascript. On the surface, it just looks like it's python, but it is more complicated than that. In python, you get to use the "=\=" to test for equality, but in javascript, you use the "=\==" equality operator and it kinda sucked.

What is specially hard in javascript is accessing the dom. In javascript, you have to access the dom because it's hard to choose which type of dom accessing to use. I also got frustrated by the properties in it such as styling, attributes. But luckily, adding click event handlers on a button is not a problem. And I tried making accordions, carousel from websites, and youtube. 

And when I got frustrated with javascript and dom, I really wanted to learn other languages. But since online class was about to start, I stopped it for a while. Combine it with the fact that I got very distracted by anime, I just continued it in November. **Stay tuned for part 2**.
