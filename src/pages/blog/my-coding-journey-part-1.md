### January 2020
As far as I remember, it all began on the January 2020. I was curious on how webpages work and I was interested to learn how to also make them. 

And it was also at that time that I saw grade 8 students writing *some gibberish* phrases in the library and when they saved and reload the website, they got pretty interested at the result the code gave. And so, I picked up the motivation needed to learn those weird looking code. Then, after that, everytime I would go to the library to learn how to code in HTML. And after I've learned enough of it, I showed my classmates how I can change the text of a website. 

But comparing my knowledge at that time to my knowledge about coding today, the comparison would be like a 2-story apartment to a 30-story hotel. Back then, I was learning too little and I realized that most of the things that I created using barebones HTML was nothing compared to the ones like messenger, facebook, youtube, and all that kind of stuff because it really looks ugly. So, I started learning on how to style elements that I code on the page. And I stumbled upon learning css.

CSS was one of "**the most clear**", and just one of the "**most downright confusing**" as the codebase grows. And most of the time, I was just **"using plain css"**. CSS is a styling language that follows the principle of cascading. The style that was last declared in the file or `<style>` tag is the one that applies to the different styles. 

Of course, CSS doesn't end there. It also has "**specificity for styling elements**". And it was such a mental overhead that I tried to quit web development. This is because as soon as your css grows, it would be \(*almost*\) hard to manage. But fortunately, with a little organization and effort, I was able to make small projects with it.

And then, I stumbled upon [Wordpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress), a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) or Content management system. In wordpress, you could basically design a webpage with a visual based editor rather than editing it by code. After realizing how much hours I've wasted in learning web development, I reflected on this question: if a [CMS \(Content Management System\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) can handle the whole website stuff, why do I need to code in html and css? And when I realized that I don't really need to code html and css, I thought that learning it is useless. 

That is what led me to quit making websites and start making desktop/mobile apps, command line interfaces, and so on.

To do that, I tried using python for programming. Python, in my opinion, is the first real programming language that I've learned because HTML and CSS are **not a programming language**. Python, is so simple that is easy to understand, very minimal way of writing code due to it having a small amount of keywords.

#### Example

```python
a_variable = 20
def print_var(insert_arg):
	print(a_variable)
```

I then realized that learning the concepts of functions and object-oriented programming is hard. Also, I realized that you can never make any real apps with these programming language. And so, I begin to wonder if, learning this can really make apps. Technically, variables, for loops, conditional statements only print out some `Hello, World!` in the command line. But even so, I tried understanding functions and arguments, classes, objects until I fully know what it is. I was shocked to realize that the concepts of functions and objects are easy.

Functions, in the context of Math, is just a wrapper around an equation that gives the **same output** given the **same input**. But functions don't end there. In programming, functions can do a lot more that. It can also do side-effects, mutations, or a combination of one of these.

Objects, in the context of programming, is just an instance of a class, which is just a wrapper of logic. It has properties, methods to change the properties, and readonly properties. It's as simple as that. 

Then after I know enough in coding python, I tried to make a calculator app. I watched videos on how to make calculator with tkinter. And when I finished making my app, it doesn't look good. I think it just looks like an app that came from the 90's. And so, I tried finding other solutions for making an app but never really had the courage to try them.

And since, web technologies are readily available when you visit a website, I try making websites anyways. But this time, I was trying to make it more interactive. So, I tried learning javascript. On the surface, it just looks like it's python, but it is more complicated than that. In python, you get to use the "=\=" to test for equality, but in javascript, you use the "=\==" equality operator and it kinda sucked.

What is specially hard in javascript is accessing the dom. In javascript, you have to access the dom because it's hard to choose which type of dom accessing to use. I also got frustrated by the properties in it such as styling, attributes. But luckily, adding click event handlers on a button is not a problem. And I tried making accordions, carousel from websites, and youtube. 

And when I got frustrated with javascript and dom, I really wanted to learn other languages. But since online class was about to start, I stopped it for a while. Combine it with the fact that I got very distracted by anime, I just continued it in November. **Stay tuned for part 2**.
